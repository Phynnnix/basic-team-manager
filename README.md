### Project Purpose

This is a follow along of a project based course published by freeCodeCamp.org.
Nothing is being copied or fetched directly from their sources, as the main purpose of this, is to get experience with setting up and writing React Apps.
The content of the page is heavily modified, that includes (not exclusively) names, descriptions and images.
The overall structure is heavily guided by the course, but will get some modifications along the way and some more after the course finished to deepen the understanding of the matter.
